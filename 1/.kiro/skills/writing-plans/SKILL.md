# Writing Plans

## Overview

Write comprehensive implementation plans assuming the engineer has zero context for the codebase and questionable taste. Document everything they need: which files to touch, code, testing, how to verify. Give them the whole plan as bite-sized tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the writing-plans skill to create the implementation plan."

**Save plans to:** `docs/superpowers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`

## File Structure

Before defining tasks, map out which files will be created or modified. Design units with clear boundaries and well-defined interfaces. Each file should have one clear responsibility. Prefer smaller, focused files over large ones.

## Bite-Sized Task Granularity

**Each step is one action (2-5 minutes):**
- "Write the failing test" - step
- "Run it to make sure it fails" - step
- "Implement the minimal code to make the test pass" - step
- "Run the tests and make sure they pass" - step
- "Commit" - step

## Plan Document Header

**Every plan MUST start with this header:**

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this builds]
**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences about approach]
**Tech Stack:** [Key technologies/libraries]

```

## Task Structure

````markdown
### Task N: [Component Name]

**Files:**
- Create: `exact/path/to/file.py`
- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.py`
- Test: `tests/exact/path/to/test.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**
```python
def test_specific_behavior():
    result = function(input)
    assert result == expected
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**
Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: FAIL

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**
```python
def function(input):
    return expected
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**
Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: PASS

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**
```bash
git add tests/path/test.py src/path/file.py
git commit -m "feat: add specific feature"
```
````

## No Placeholders

Never write:
- "TBD", "TODO", "implement later"
- "Add appropriate error handling" (without actual code)
- "Write tests for the above" (without actual test code)
- "Similar to Task N" (repeat the code)

Every step must contain the actual content an engineer needs.

## Self-Review

After writing the complete plan, check:
1. **Spec coverage:** Can you point to a task for each requirement?
2. **Placeholder scan:** Any of the forbidden patterns above?
3. **Type consistency:** Do types/method names match across tasks?

## Execution Handoff

After saving the plan, offer:
- **Inline Execution** - Execute tasks in this session using executing-plans skill
